Summary:

Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the WPA Pre-Shared Key in the wireless settings panel in the administrator web UI in ASUS RT-AC51U wireless router 
firmware allows injection of arbitrary web script or HTML with a maximum of 63 characters.
Affects firmware versions up to and including ASUS RT-AC51U 3.0.0.4.380.8591.

Prerequisites:

Access to the administrator web UI of the wireless router.

Steps to reproduce:

1. Log into the administrator web UI of the wirelss router and navigate to the Advanced Settings: Wireless page.
2. Type into the WPA Pre-Shared Key field: <script>alert('Hi')</script>. If the script is too long for the field, one can edit the HTML to remove it. Right-click 
   on the field and select the "Inspect" option and remove the maximum length in the HTML.
3. Save the settings and this will redirect to a new page, where, in this case, the unsanitised password will display an alert box with 'Hi'. Other scripts and 
   HTMLs can be run as long as the maximum length is 63 characters.
